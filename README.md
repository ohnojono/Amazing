# Amazing
###Introduction
**A-maze-ing** is the first experimental mini project of [**Playable Prints**](http://www.watershed.co.uk/studio/projects/playable-prints-watershed-new-talent-residency), a project by [Jono Sandilands](http://www.jonosandilands.com/) and part of a New Talent Residency at The Watershed / Pervasive Media Studio, Bristol, UK. 

Amazing will be housed in a board game style box, running on an iPad with the intention to look like a retro game until picked up and played. The maze generates a new path each new game.

####Tutorials
A maze style game was initially chosen as a starting point to learn Unity and therfore mainly derives from these tutorials:

* [**Roll-a-ball**](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial) *Official Unity tutorial*
* [**Creating a maze generator**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzENv_ZRA1g) *Flat Tutorials*

####Control
The game should be built to iOS to play, it requires use of the accelerometer to control the player/ball.

For testing in game view you can use [Unity Remote 4](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/unity-remote-4/id871767552?mt=8).

Shake device to reset.

####Feature ideas

* **Timer** *add countdown to create immediacy*
* **Style** *give the game a better look*
* **Collect** *bonus elements to collect to make more interesting*
